EnvMan4J
========

Application that manage environment variables under windows. Designed especially for Java related settings

This application is written on Lazarus/Free Pascal.
Why I didn't write in on Java? Because I have to have configured JAVA_HOME on my PC. But I whant to configure it with this app.
